0,Training a virtual agent to outperform human players can teach us how to optimize different processes in a variety of different and exciting subfields,Reinforcement Learning
1,"This is what Google DeepMind did with its popular AlphaGo, which beat the strongest Go player in history and scored a goal that was considered impossible at the time.In this article, we will develop an AI agent that is able to learn how to play the popular game Snake from scratch",Reinforcement Learning
2,"To do it, we implement a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm using both Keras on top of Tensorflow and PyTorch (both versions are available, you can choose the one you prefer)",Reinforcement Learning
3,This approach consists in the interaction between two components: an environment (the game itself) and an agent (Snake),Reinforcement Learning
4,The agent collects information about its current state (we will see later what this means) and performs an action accordingly,Reinforcement Learning
5,The environment rewards or punishes the agent based on the performed action,Reinforcement Learning
6,"Over time, the agent learns what actions maximize the reward (in our case, what actions lead to eating the apple and avoiding the walls)",Reinforcement Learning
7,No rules about the game are given,Reinforcement Learning
8,"Initially, Snake does not know what to do and performs random actions",Reinforcement Learning
9,"The goal is to elaborate a strategy (technically called “policy”) to maximize the score — or the reward.We are going to see how a Deep Q-Learning algorithm learns to play Snake, scoring up to 50 points and showing a solid strategy in just 5 minutes of training",Reinforcement Learning
10,"Optionally, the code shows how to optimize the Artificial Neural Network using Bayesian Optimization",Reinforcement Learning
11,Reinforcement Learning is a family of algorithms and techniques used for Control (e.g,Reinforcement Learning
12,"Robotics, Autonomous driving, etc..) and Decision making",Reinforcement Learning
13,These approaches solve problems that need to be expressed as a Markov Decision Process (MDP),Reinforcement Learning
14,"What does this mean? It means that we need to describe our game by a set of states S (for example, an index based on Snake’s position), a set of actions A (for example, Up, Down, Right, Left), a reward function R (for example, +10 when Snake eats an apple, -10 when Snakes hits a wall) and optionally a transition function T that describes the transitions among states",Reinforcement Learning
15,Traditional ML algorithms need to be trained with an input and a “correct answer” called target,Reinforcement Learning
16,The system will then try to learn how to predict targets based on unseen inputs,Reinforcement Learning
17,"In this example, we don’t know the best action to take at each state of the game (this is actually what we are trying to learn!), so a traditional approach would not be effective",Reinforcement Learning
18,"In Reinforcement Learning, we have two main components: the environment (our game) and the agent (our Snake.",Reinforcement Learning
19,"or to be correct, the Deep Neural Network that drives our Snake’s actions)",Reinforcement Learning
20,"Every time the agent performs an action, the environment gives a reward to the agent, which can be positive or negative depending on how good the action was from that specific state",Reinforcement Learning
21,"The goal of the agent is to learn what actions maximize the reward, given every possible state",Reinforcement Learning
22,States are the observations that the agent receives at each iteration from the environment,Reinforcement Learning
23,"A state can be its position, its speed, or whatever array of variables describes the environment",Reinforcement Learning
24,"To be more rigorous and to use a Reinforcement Learning notation, the strategy used by the agent to make decisions is called policy",Reinforcement Learning
25,"On a theoretical level, a policy is a mapping from the state space (the space of all the possible observations that the agent can receive) into the action space (the space of all the actions the agent can take, say UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT)",Reinforcement Learning
26,A Q-table is a matrix that correlates the state of the agent with the possible actions that the agent can adopt,Reinforcement Learning
27,"The values in the table are the action’s probability of success (technically, a measure of the expected cumulative reward), which were updated based on the rewards the agent received during training",Reinforcement Learning
28,"In the example, we might want to choose RIGHT if we are in State 2, and we might want to go UP if we are in State 4",Reinforcement Learning
29,The values in the Q-Table represent the cumulative expected reward of taking action a from a state s,Reinforcement Learning
30,"In other words, these values give us an indication of the average reward that the agent obtains if it takes action a from that state s",Reinforcement Learning
31,This table is the policy of the agent that we mentioned before: it determines what actions should be taken from every state to maximize the expected reward,Reinforcement Learning
32,Deep Q-Learning increases the potentiality of Q-Learning by converting the table into Deep Neural Network — that is a powerful representation of a parametrized function,Reinforcement Learning
33,"When the AI chooses and performs the action, the environment gives a reward to the agent",Reinforcement Learning
34,"Then, the agent reaches the new state state’ and it updates its Q-value according to the Bellman equation as mentioned above",Reinforcement Learning
35,"Also, for each move, it stores the original state, the action, the state reached after performed that action, the reward obtained and whether the game ended or not",Reinforcement Learning
36,This data is later sampled to train the neural network,Reinforcement Learning
37,This operation is called Replay Memory,Reinforcement Learning
38,A state is the representation of a situation in which the agent finds itself,Reinforcement Learning
39,The state also represents the input of the Neural network,Reinforcement Learning
40,the AI tries to maximize the expected reward,Reinforcement Learning
41,"In our case, a positive reward is only given to the agent when it eats the food target (+10)",Reinforcement Learning
42,"If the snake hits a wall or hits itself, the reward is negative (-10)",Reinforcement Learning
43,"Additionally, we could give a positive reward for each step Snake takes without dying",Reinforcement Learning
44,"In that case, Snake might exploit the situation by running in a circle instead of reaching the food, since it would get positive rewards for each step while avoiding the risk of collision against a wall",Reinforcement Learning
45,"Sometimes, Reinforcement Learning agents outsmart us, presenting flaws in our strategy that we did not anticipate",Reinforcement Learning

48,"The learning rate is not fixed, it starts at 0.0005 and decreases to 0.000005",Reinforcement Learning
49,"Different architectures and different hyper-parameters contribute to a quicker convergence to an optimum, as well as possible highest scores",Reinforcement Learning

74,"Learning the agent how to run is a first step in building a new generation of prosthetic legs, ones that automatically recognize people’s walking patterns and tweak themselves to make moving easier and more effective",Reinforcement Learning
75,"While it is possible and has been done in Stanford’s labs, hard-wiring all the commands and predicting all possible patterns of walking requires a lot of work from highly skilled programmers",Reinforcement Learning
76,"Reinforcement learning, as stated above employs a system of rewards and penalties to compel the computer to solve a problem by itself",Reinforcement Learning
77,Human involvement is limited to changing the environment and tweaking the system of rewards and penalties,Reinforcement Learning
78,"As the computer maximizes the reward, it is prone to seeking unexpected ways of doing it",Reinforcement Learning
79,Human involvement is focused on preventing it from exploiting the system and motivating the machine to perform the task in the way expected,Reinforcement Learning
80,"Reinforcement learning is useful when there is no “proper way” to perform a task, yet there are rules the model has to follow to perform its duties correctly",Reinforcement Learning

85,"Bellemare, who introduced Atari video games as a reinforcement learning benchmark, “although challenging, these environments remain simple enough that we can hope to achieve measurable progress as we attempt to solve them”",Reinforcement Learning
86,"Deep reinforcement learning, the algorithm used by state-of-the-art game-playing bots, starts by providing an agent with a set of possible actions in the game, a mechanism to receive feedback from the environment, and a goal to pursue",Reinforcement Learning
87,"Then, through numerous episodes of gameplay, the RL agent gradually goes from taking random actions to learning sequences of actions that can help it maximize its goal",Reinforcement Learning

92,"Ross Allen, AI researcher at Lincoln Laboratory and co-author of the paper, told TechTalks",Reinforcement Learning
93,"“While many such technology gaps exist (e.g., the real world is characterized by uncertainty/partial-observability, data scarcity, ambiguous/nuanced objectives, disparate timescales of decision making, etc.), we identified the need to collaborate with humans as a key technology gap for applying RL in the real-world",Reinforcement Learning
94,"In fact, in some cases, the reinforcement systems have managed to hack the games and find tricks that baffled even the most talented and experienced human players",Reinforcement Learning

100,"Reinforcement learning is a special branch of AI algorithms that is composed of three key elements: an environment, agents, and rewards",Reinforcement Learning
101,"By performing actions, the agent changes its own state and that of the environment",Reinforcement Learning
102,"Based on how much those actions affect the goal the agent must achieve, it is rewarded or penalized",Reinforcement Learning
103,"In many reinforcement learning problems, the agent has no initial knowledge of the environment and starts by taking random actions",Reinforcement Learning
